<pre>
The wind it sings through branches high,
A silver thread in cobalt sky,
It tells of lands both near and far,
And carries dreams where starlights are.

It brushes leaves in soft parade,
A lullaby the dusk has made,
And through the hush of twilight's glow,
It murmurs truths we used to know.

So pause a while and let it speak,
Its voice is old, its wisdom sleek,
For in the breath of wandering air,
Are stories waiting everywhere.
